Issues with Rev. A

* LM1117-3.3V is all messed up.  Pin 1 = GND, Pin 2 = Vout, Pin3 = Vin
  Note that pin 2 is connected to the thermal pad. [fixed]

* ISP socket does not mark pin 1 [fixed]

* C7 artwork is not properly placed [fixed]

* D1 Shottky Diode has no part number. [fixed]

* Check for + signs on C1, C3, and C5

* R9 and R10 should be marked 470 ohms. [fixed]

* D2 + sign is hard to see. [fixed]

* Many of the schematic sheets are not 8.5 x 11. [fixed]


Additions:

* Think about adding an ISP programming mini-shield so one
  Busino can program another with a simple 6 pin cable.
